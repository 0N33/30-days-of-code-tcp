        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
        From a young age, I was interested in technology, especially IoT and games.
        During the COVID period, I started learning game development and created a
        small game along with a few basic IoT projects like air quality checker. After that, my focus shifted
        towards JEE preparation, and most of my time was spent on studies during that
        phase.

        <h2>Experience & Achievements</h2>
       
        <p>
            I completed my schooling with a strong interest in science and mathematics.
        After my school education, I prepared for the JEE examination, which helped
        me develop discipline, consistency, and problem-solving skills. Currently,
        I am pursuing my engineering degree and focusing on building my technical
        foundation in programming and core computer science subjects.
